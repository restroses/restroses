            <p>Just like a thunder in the middle of pouring rain</p>
            <p> I never knew I'm in awe that in my life, you came</p>
            <p> I wasn't a really a fan of fairy tales and disneys</p>
            <p> But you make me clung to the beauty of uncertainties </p>
                
            <p> I was struck by your beauty at first</p>
            <p> Never had an idea that in your love, I thirst</p>
            <p> You captured my heart, and my attention</p>
            <p> I was delighted by your pure intention</p>
                
            <p> In depth of the sea, and vastness of sky</p>
            <p> I swear that all you have to do in me, is to trust</p>
            <p> I'll let my feelings grow, flow, and fly</p>
